Hello, world! I'm a software engineer focused on search, database systems, and
statistical computing. I currently work on code search and AI-assisted software
development at [Sourcegraph](https://about.sourcegraph.com/), and serve as an
[Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/) committer and PMC member. I'm also
the author of the [generalized random forests (grf) package](https://grf-labs.github.io/grf/).

I love building software that's empowering and enjoyable to use. I'm an open
source enthusiast, and shared my experience joining the open source search
community in
*[Finding a home (and career) in the open source community](https://www.elastic.co/blog/culture-finding-a-home-and-career-in-the-open-source-community)*.

Before Sourcegraph, I worked at [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/) on the
Elasticsearch search engine.

#### Vector search
There's been a surge of interest in vector search, thanks to a new generation
of machine learning models that powerfully represent text and other content as
vectors. I helped introduce k-nearest neighbor search in Lucene and Elasticsearch,
opening up new possibilites for ranking and recommendations.

* *[Text similarity search with vectors in Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/blog/text-similarity-search-with-vectors-in-elasticsearch)*

#### Machine learning for causal inference
Causal inference allows for determining the effect of an action on a
larger system. The generalized random forests (grf) method combines insights
from statistics and machine learning to enable causal analysis. The associated
[software package](https://grf-labs.github.io/grf/) is becoming a popular choice
for social scientists investigating causal effects.

#### Information extraction
During my Master's degree I researched relation extraction and knowledge base
population as part of the Stanford Natural Language Processing group. Our work
focused on non-traditional supervision techniques, including multi-label
learning, partial supervision, as well as methods to address labelling errors in
training data.
